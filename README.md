# BlackSwam-Test
Test for a role in BlackSwam, London


## Description
https://github.com/BlackSwanLtd/iOSFever
Show us what you can do and how clean your code is! Write an app that uses public APIs to fetch data and display it in an organized way.

Even if we all love playing with Swift (who doesn't ;)), please stick with the plain old Objective-C here.

For example:

A StackOverflow client that shows the hottest questions
An app that shows random images of cats from The Cat API
An app that downloads the NSHipster RSS feed showing and index of all the articles and that alerts the user when the latest article is published
Anything you can come up with!
We could be sneaky and not say anything else, but here's some things we're looking to see:

Use of existing open source libraries
Standard best practises for Networking - Not reiventing the wheel
Tests!
In this test we don't care too much about the UI, what we care is how good the code is!
